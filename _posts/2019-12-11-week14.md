Week 14: Reflection
-

Looking back on my first two posts, I understand how important Open Source was back then, and it still is just as important now. The course itself was much different from what I was expecting, however. When I first was introduced to Open Source, or more accurately Github, I thought that it was an always-online ordeal. I thought that any new iteration on an open source project, while it can be worked on and changed independently, was going to be done solely on Github. It was a little silly thinking that would have been the case, as an internet connection is definitely not a requirement to work on whatever project was being worked on. My expectation was adjusted from a pure coding focus to all the other aspects of open source that I hadn't considered, from translations and bug reports, to the actual meat of coding.

Then again, I understood that even contributing information to Wikipedia would be considered as Open Source. And while that is still the case, I thought that it would have been different from contributing to Godot or any other Open Source project. While I would definitely choose a different project from Godot to contribute to, it was still a good learning experience to get my feet wet in Open Source.

Overall, in spite of any setbacks I may have had during the entirety of the course, taking the course itself was a wonderful experience, to understand and learn about Open Source.
