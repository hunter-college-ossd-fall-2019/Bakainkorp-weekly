Week 11: Going On in Godot
-

This week was focused all on the main project, Godot. As mentioned previously, I wanted to concentrate on adding translations to the program, as it was by far the most comfortable way to contribute to the project. However, there were quite a few words that, while I did know in the Filipino language, there were many ways to consider the words.

To explain, take one of the words "close" in English. Now, close can mean a couple of things. You can close a window, you can close a house, and you can close a computer. If you were in second place in a race by a small margin, you would call it "close." Because of this, translations that I made would have to be appropriate to the context. This incentivised me to take a *close*r look at where the strings were coming from, and understand how what it means in the context of the program.
