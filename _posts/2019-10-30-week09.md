Week 8: Rebasing Previous Topics
-

Last week, I posted about three topics. The first topic was about selecting an existing Open Source project, and discussing the various diffiulties and overal situation with the project. The second topic was about two articles, a chapter in the book called Git Branching in a Nutshell, and another article called The Cathedral and the Baazar. The third topic was about Bill Reyner's visit, and his discussion about the various topics involving.

I personally have made a mistake, as some of those topics were meant to be discussed for this week. So, I will go through the topics that were to be discussed in greater detail, as well as a summary of the past week.

**The Cathedral and the Bazaar**
-

The Cathedral and the Bazaar, located [here](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html), is an article by Eric Steven Raymond. He talks about the comparison between open and closed software, creating an aphorism between a cathedral and a bazaar.
