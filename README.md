This repository belongs to Bakainkorp and contains weekly blogs written by Bakainkorp.
This repository is for a course in Open Source software development.

These weekly blogs is an essential part of the course; this is to ensure that I, Bakainkorp, will continue forth with the topics that are covered in the lectures, as well as any assignments given to me to complete.
